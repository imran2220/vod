        <h3>IMPORTANT TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT </h3>
      </section>
      <p> Please take a few minutes to read the  following important terms. Further terms and conditions are set out later in  this Contract, which you should also read carefully. Can I subscribe to the  Service? Yes, if you are 18 or over and you use the Service only on your  Device(s) in either country or territory. How much does the Service cost and  how do I pay for it? 3at3oot TV subscribers must pay a Subscription Payment to  use the Service. Payments will be prepaid monthly or annually. Pricing  information is displayed on the Website and/or within the Service at the point  from which you can access Content. What network connection do I need to access  the Service? Access to the Service is dependent on you having an adequate  broadband Internet connection (minimum 2Mbps recommended per Device accessing  the service concurrently) and/or 3G Mobile Network (180-1400Kbps recommended  depending on the Content you want to watch and the Device you are using).  Further information on these requirements is set out on the Website. What  Content is available? The Content that is available on the Service depends on  the part of the Service you are subscribing to and is set out on the Website  and updated from time to time. Due to rights restrictions, we may be unable to  make certain programs available via the Service or we may be unable to show  Content on certain Devices (see Website for details). Will the Service change?  The Service is variable and therefore may change from time to time. (Some of  the Content available on the Service is supplied by other broadcasters and  therefore the availability of such Content is outside our control.) How much  notice will I get if you change the Service or increase my Subscription  Payment? We will give you at least 31 days? Notice before we change the Service  to your material disadvantage (unless an immediate change is required for  security reasons) or increase your Subscription Payment, unless such increase  results from: (a) you changing your subscription; or (b) us being required to  increase our prices by law or because a regulatory authority requests or  requires us to do so (if this happens we will try to give you reasonable notice  in writing). If you are not the payer of the Subscription Payment, you should  tell the payer about any price increase notice we send you. What are my rights  to cancel? During the eight working days following the date when you first  subscribe to the Service, you can cancel your subscription and we will  reimburse you for any Subscription Payments and/or One-Off Payments you have made,  provided you do not begin using that part of the Service to which the  Subscription Payments and/or One-Off Payments relate. If you start using that  part or those parts of the Service to which the Subscription Payments and/or  One-Off Payments relate, your rights to a reimbursement will end. After eight  working days following the date when you first subscribe to the Service, you  can inform us that you wish to cancel your subscription at any time in  accordance with clause 7 of this Contract. How do special offers affect my  Contract? If you are eligible for and take up a special offer, the relevant  terms and conditions in this Contract will be varied to take account of the  offer terms and conditions. </p>
